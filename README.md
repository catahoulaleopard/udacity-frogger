# udacity-frogger

Squirreller is a take on the arcade game, Frogger. 

This is a project focussing on Object-Oriented JavaScript for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

<h2>Gameplay:</h2>
Using the arrow keys, move your squirrel safely up the screen, avoiding bugs and bears to get to the river. Each time your squirrel makes it to the water without colliding with an enemy, you get a point. 

How many points can you get? Of course, the more points you get, the more difficult the game becomes.

If your squirrel is run over by an enemy, you can start the game over by refreshing the browser.
