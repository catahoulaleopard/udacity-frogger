# udacity-frogger-type-game

Squirreller is a take on the arcade game, Frogger. (This is a project in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree focussing on Object-Oriented JavaScript.)

##To Start:
Download and unzip these repository files, then open `index.html` in a browser.

##Gameplay:
Using the arrow keys, move your :squirrel:squirrel safely up the screen, avoiding :beetle:bugs and :bear:bears to get to the river. Each time your squirrel makes it to the water without colliding with an enemy, you get a point. 

How many points can you get? Of course, the more points you get, the more difficult the game becomes.

If your squirrel is run over by an enemy, you can start the game over by :arrows_counterclockwise:refreshing the browser.
